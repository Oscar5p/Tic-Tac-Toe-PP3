Each player takes turns
The markers are either "X" or "0"
If all spots are taken without three in a row the game will be a draw/tie game

# Deployment/Heroku
### Since i didn't get my student pack i couldn't deploy on heroku so that will be a problem for me
### I'm very happy with this course and support but i feel like i didn't get enough help with this issue.
### Other then that i feel like it went pretty good with the project and so on. i have been in contact with student care but haven't heard anything yet.
I will submit as noraml but i'm hoping to get some indulgence on this problem.
Best regards
